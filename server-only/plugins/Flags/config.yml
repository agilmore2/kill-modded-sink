Flags:
  # This sets the search order for land allocation systems  
  # If you have only one system installed, you do not need to change this.
  #
  # If you have more than one system installed, change the order so the system
  # that you wish Flags to use appears first.
  #
  # DO NOT ALTER THE NAMES
  #
  # If no system is discovered, you will be limited to world flags only.
  #
  AreaPlugins: [Factions, GriefPrevention, InfinitePlots, PlotMe, Residence, WorldGuard]

  # Disable this to improve performance. However, any flag module using it will not
  # receive notice that a player is changing areas.
  #
  # Divisors:
  # Decrease these to make the border crossing based events react faster.
  # Increase them to reduce event execution time.  It may help reduce lag on busy servers.
  # Setting these to 1 will process every event.  Do not set lower than 1, use only whole numbers.

  # PLUGIN: Player will be charged when the new flag value differs from default provided by the flag module or plugin.
  # DEFAULT: Player will be charged when the new flag value differs from operator defined default value.
  # ALWAYS: Player is always charged for setting the flag value.
  #
  # Refund allows the player to gain back the cost of the flag if the value is set
  # to the PLUGIN or DEFAULT value.  If BaseValue is ALWAYS, refunds will only
  # be given if the flag is removed.
  # WARNING: Players will always be refunded the current price, 
  #          even if they bought it at a different price.
